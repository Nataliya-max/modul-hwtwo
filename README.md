🧳 Trip Planner App
A simple and fun React application to organize your trip plans day-by-day!
You can mark each plan as complete — when you complete a point, it disappears.
When all plans are completed, the main headline (h1) updates to celebrate your success! 🎉

✨ Features
📋 See a list of your daily trip plans.

✅ Mark plans as "Complete" by pressing a button.

🚀 Completed plans disappear from the list.

🎉 When all plans are completed, the main h1 text changes to a success message!

💡 How It Works
State Management:
The app uses React useState to keep track of the list of plans.

Complete Button:
When you click "Complete", the corresponding plan is removed from the list.

Dynamic Title:
When the list becomes empty (i.e., all plans completed), the <h1> text automatically changes.

🏖️ Future Ideas
Add ability to edit plans.

Allow adding new plans.

Save progress using localStorage.

Animations when plans disappear.

Would you also like me to create a quick example of the main code (App.jsx) too? 🚀
It would only take a minute!
